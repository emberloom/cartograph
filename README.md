> [!WARNING]
> **Early development.** Cartograph is actively developed and internals may change between versions. Expect rough edges — bug reports and PRs are welcome.

Cartograph builds a **structural and historical model of any codebase**. It parses source code into a dependency graph (Layer 1) and mines git history for co-change patterns and code ownership (Layer 2). The result is queryable via CLI or an MCP server.

**Used by AI agents and humans to understand code before changing it.** Instead of loading entire codebases into context, agents call Cartograph to answer targeted questions: what does this file affect, who owns it, what tends to break together.

> Cartograph is used by [Emberloom Sparks](https://github.com/emberloom/sparks) as its built-in codebase-understanding layer — agents query it before making changes to understand blast radius and ownership.

## Demo

**[Interactive visualization of ripgrep →](https://emberloom.github.io/cartograph/demo.html)**

100 files, 69 import edges, 42 co-change pairs. Click any node to see its blast radius. Toggle import / co-change layers. Nodes sized by connectivity, colored by crate.

Generate your own:

```bash
python3 scripts/viz.py \
  --db /path/to/repo/.cartograph/db.sqlite \
  --repo-name "myrepo" \
  --out demo.html
```

## What's New

First public release — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list:

- **Dependency graph** — tree-sitter parses Rust source into a directed graph backed by petgraph and SQLite
- **Git history mining** — co-change frequency and blame-based ownership from git2
- **Blast radius traversal** — reachability query over the dependency graph
- **MCP stdio server** — 5 tools exposed to Claude Code and any MCP-compatible client
- **7-subcommand CLI** — `index`, `blast-radius`, `hotspots`, `co-changes`, `who-owns`, `deps`, `serve`
- **29 passing tests** — unit + end-to-end coverage

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/emberloom/cartograph.git
cd cartograph

# Build
cargo build --release

# Index a repository (builds the graph + mines git history)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo index

# Query blast radius (what does changing this file affect?)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo blast-radius src/main.rs

# Show hotspots (most-connected files)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo hotspots

# Show co-changes (files that tend to change together)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo co-changes src/main.rs

# Show ownership (who last touched what)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo who-owns src/main.rs

# Show dependencies (upstream and downstream)
cargo run --release -- --repo /path/to/your/repo deps src/main.rs
```

The index is stored in `.cartograph/db.sqlite` inside your repo. Re-run `index` to update it.

---

## MCP Setup for Claude Code

Add this to your Claude Code MCP settings (`~/.claude/mcp_servers.json` or project-level `.claude/mcp_servers.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cartograph": {
      "command": "cargo",
      "args": [
        "run", "--release",
        "--manifest-path", "/path/to/cartograph/Cargo.toml",
        "--",
        "--repo", "/path/to/your/repo",
        "--db", "/path/to/your/repo/.cartograph/db.sqlite",
        "serve"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Cartograph will then be available as tools that Claude can call to understand your codebase. Run `index` once beforehand to build the database.

[Emberloom Sparks](https://github.com/emberloom/sparks) uses Cartograph this way out of the box — if you're running Sparks, add `cartograph` to your MCP registry in `config.toml` to give your agents codebase-aware context.

---

## Available Tools (MCP)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cartograph_blast_radius` | Impact analysis — which files are reachable from a given file in the dependency graph |
| `cartograph_dependencies` | Upstream and downstream dependencies for a file |
| `cartograph_co_changes` | Files that statistically tend to change together (from git history) |
| `cartograph_who_owns` | Code ownership derived from git blame |
| `cartograph_hotspots` | Most-connected files in the codebase — highest blast radius surface area |

├──────────────────┴──────────────────────┤
│         Store (SQLite + petgraph)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layer 1 — Structure:** tree-sitter parses source files and extracts module/import relationships into a directed dependency graph backed by petgraph and persisted in SQLite.

**Layer 2 — Dynamics:** git2 walks the commit history to compute co-change frequency (files that appear together in commits) and ownership (blame-based author attribution per file).

**Query Engine:** graph traversals and SQL queries over the store, exposed through a unified interface to both the CLI and the MCP stdio server.

---

## v0.1.0 Scope

**Included:**
- Rust source parser (tree-sitter)
- Git history mining — co-changes and ownership
- Dependency graph with blast radius traversal
- CLI with 7 subcommands: `index`, `blast-radius`, `hotspots`, `co-changes`, `who-owns`, `deps`, `serve`
- MCP stdio server with 5 tools
- SQLite + petgraph store
- 29 passing tests

**Coming next:**
- Additional language parsers (TypeScript, Python, Go)
- Layer 3: institutional knowledge (PR descriptions, commit messages, design docs)
- Layer 4: change simulator — predict the probable impact of a proposed change before it's made
